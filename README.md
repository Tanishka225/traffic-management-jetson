# traffic-management-jetson
The project focuses on creating an intelligent traffic management and road condition monitoring system leveraging the powerful capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. The system is designed to enhance road safety and improve traffic flow by utilizing computer vision techniques to monitor traffic and detect potholes in real-time. The project integrates various machine learning libraries, including OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, for both traffic analysis and pothole detection. The system aims to provide valuable insights into traffic patterns and road quality, contributing to smarter city planning and more responsive traffic management.
